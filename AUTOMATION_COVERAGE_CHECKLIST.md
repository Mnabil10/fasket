- [ ] Ops alerts: ops.order_stuck, ops.automation_misconfigured, ops.automation_delivery_failed logged + sent to outbox + Sentry
- [ ] Automation queue misconfig/dead-letter does not block core flows (events stay PENDING/FAILED with nextAttemptAt)
- [ ] Support audit backfill run (masked phone/order code populated)
- [ ] Profit export guarded by max range; XLSX disabled unless implemented
- [ ] Automation HMAC/IP enforced with explicit config (AUTOMATION_ALLOWED_IPS, AUTMATION_HMAC_SECRET)
